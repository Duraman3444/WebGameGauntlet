## üéÆ **Day 1 Roadmap**

### **üåÖ Morning Session (4 hours): Godot Fundamentals**

#### **Hour 1: AI-Accelerated Learning**
Start with these **exact AI prompts** for maximum learning velocity:

**Prompt 1: Architecture Deep Dive**
```
I'm building a multiplayer 2D platformer in Godot 4.x. I come from a JavaScript/web background. Explain:

1. How Godot's scene system differs from traditional game loops
2. Node hierarchy best practices for 2D games
3. GDScript syntax - what's similar to Python and what's different
4. Built-in physics system - CharacterBody2D vs RigidBody2D vs Area2D
5. Animation system - AnimationPlayer vs AnimationTree

Give me practical examples for a platformer game.
```

**Prompt 2: Multiplayer Architecture**
```
Design a multiplayer architecture for a 2D platformer in Godot 4.x with these requirements:
- 2-4 players competing in real-time
- Fruit collection with score tracking
- Enemy AI that works across clients
- State synchronization for positions and animations
- Lag compensation strategies

Compare client-server vs peer-to-peer approaches and recommend the best option.
```

#### **Hour 2: Create Your First Scene**
1. Create `scenes/Main.tscn`
2. Add these nodes:
   - `Main` (Node2D)
   - `GameManager` (Node) - attach `scripts/GameManager.gd`
   - `Player` (CharacterBody2D) - attach `scripts/Player.gd`
   - `Camera2D` (child of Player)

**AI Prompt for Scene Setup:**
```
Help me set up a basic Godot scene for a 2D platformer:
1. Proper node hierarchy for Main scene
2. Player CharacterBody2D setup with collision
3. Camera2D configuration for smooth following
4. Basic level geometry using TileMap

Show me the exact steps and node structure.
```

#### **Hour 3: Player Movement**
**AI Prompt:**
```
Create a robust player controller for Godot 4.x CharacterBody2D:
1. WASD + Arrow key movement
2. Variable jump height (tap vs hold)
3. Double jump mechanics
4. Proper collision detection
5. Smooth animations for idle, run, jump, fall
6. Wall jumping (optional)

Provide complete GDScript code with explanations.
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement basic movement in `scripts/Player.gd`
- [ ] Add character sprites from assets
- [ ] Create animations using existing character assets
- [ ] Test movement feels responsive

#### **Hour 4: Asset Integration**
**AI Prompt:**
```
Help me integrate 2D sprite assets into Godot:
1. Import settings for pixel art (no filter, proper scaling)
2. Setting up sprite sheets and animations
3. Creating AnimationPlayer animations from sprite strips
4. Best practices for organizing game assets
5. Performance optimization for 2D sprites

My assets are in: assets/sprites/players/Main Characters/
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Import character sprites correctly
- [ ] Create idle, run, jump, fall animations
- [ ] Set up proper collision shapes
- [ ] Test character visuals

2. Player management (add/remove players, scoring)
3. Level progression system
4. Timer and win condition checking
5. Preparation for multiplayer (Day 2)

Provide complete GDScript implementation.
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement game state management
- [ ] Add player to game and test scoring
- [ ] Create basic UI for score display
- [ ] Test game loop (start, play, end)

#### **Hour 6: Enemy AI**
**AI Prompt:**
```
Create enemy AI for a 2D platformer with these behaviors:
1. Patrol between two points
2. Chase player when in range
3. Attack when close enough
4. State machine implementation
5. Collision with platforms and walls
6. Health system and death

Use existing enemy sprites and prepare for multiplayer sync.
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement basic enemy AI
- [ ] Create enemy scenes with detection areas
- [ ] Add enemy sprites and animations
- [ ] Test patrol and chase behaviors

#### **Hour 7: Fruit Collection**
**AI Prompt:**
```
Create a fruit collection system for a competitive platformer:
1. Floating animation for fruits
2. Collection on player contact
3. Score system integration
4. Visual/audio feedback
5. Particle effects for collection
6. Automatic despawn after time

Prepare for multiplayer synchronization.
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement fruit collection mechanics
- [ ] Add fruit sprites and floating animation
- [ ] Create collection particle effects
- [ ] Test score updates

#### **Hour 8: Level Creation**
**AI Prompt:**
```
Help me create a 2D platformer level in Godot:
1. TileMap setup for platforms and terrain
2. Proper collision layer configuration
3. Background and foreground elements
4. Enemy and fruit spawn points
5. Level bounds and camera limits
6. Performance optimization for 2D levels

Use existing tileset assets.
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create basic level using existing tilesets
- [ ] Add collision layers for platforms
